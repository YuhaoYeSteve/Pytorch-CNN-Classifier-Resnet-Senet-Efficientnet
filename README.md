# Pytorch-CNN-Classify-Resnet-Senet-Efficientnet
Customized Image Classifier based on Pytorch with visdom visualization Support customized dataset, augmentation and SOTA CNN(Resnet, Senet, EfficientNet....))

## Highlights

- **Simple:** One-sentence method summary: use keypoint detection technic to detect the bounding box center point and regress to all other object properties like bounding box size, 3d information, and pose.

- **Versatile:** The same framework works for object detection, 3d bounding box estimation, and multi-person pose estimation with minor modification.

- **Fast:** The whole process in a single network feedforward. No NMS post processing is needed. Our DLA-34 model runs at *52* FPS with *37.4* COCO AP.

- **Strong**: Our best single model achieves *45.1*AP on COCO test-dev.

- **Easy to use:** We provide user friendly testing API and webcam demos.
